Templates used for section pages are lists and therefore have all the variables and methods available to list pages.

## Add Content and Front Matter to Section Templates

To effectively leverage section page templates, you should first understand Hugo's [content organization](en/docs/content-management/organization/) and, specifically, the purpose of `_index.md` for adding content and front matter to section and other list pages.


## Page Kinds

Every `Page` in Hugo has a `.Kind` attribute.

{{% page-kinds %}}

## `.Site.GetPage` with Sections


`Kind` can easily be combined with the where` function in your templates to create kind-specific lists of content. This method is ideal for creating lists, but there are times where you may want to fetch just the index page of a single section via the section's path.

The `.GetPage` function looks up an index page of a given `Kind` and `path`.

You can call `.Site.GetPage` with two arguments: `kind` (one of the valid values
of `Kind` from above) and `kind value`.

Examples:

- `{{ .Site.GetPage "section" "posts" }}`
- `{{ .Site.GetPage "page" "search" }}`

## Example: Creating a Default Section Template

layouts/_default/section.html
```
{{ define "main" }}
  <main>
    {{ .Content }}
      <ul class="contents">
        {{ range .Paginator.Pages }}
          <li>{{.Title}}
              <div>
                {{ partial "summary.html" . }}
              </div>
          </li>
        {{ end }}
      </ul>
    {{ partial "pagination.html" . }}
  </main>
{{ end }}
```

### Example: Using `.Site.GetPage`

The `.Site.GetPage` example that follows assumes the following project directory structure:

```
.
└── content
    ├── blog
    │   ├── _index.md # "title: My Hugo Blog" in the front matter
    │   ├── post-1.md
    │   ├── post-2.md
    │   └── post-3.md
    └── events #Note there is no _index.md file in "events"
        ├── event-1.md
        └── event-2.md
```

`.Site.GetPage` will return `nil` if no `_index.md` page is found. Therefore, if `content/blog/_index.md` does not exist, the template will output the section name:

```
<h1>{{ with .Site.GetPage "section" "blog" }}{{ .Title }}{{ end }}</h1>
```

Since `blog` has a section index page with front matter at `content/blog/_index.md`, the above code will return the following result:

```
<h1>My Hugo Blog</h1>
```

If we try the same code with the `events` section, however, Hugo will default to the section title because there is no `content/events/_index.md` from which to pull content and front matter:

```
<h1>{{ with .Site.GetPage "section" "events" }}{{ .Title }}{{ end }}</h1>
```

Which then returns the following:

```
<h1>Events</h1>
```
