Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesnâ€™t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.

Shortcodes are simple snippets inside your content files calling built-in or custom templates.

But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it's pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.

To avoid this limitations, Hugo created [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/). A shortcode is a simple snippet inside a page.

**Hugo-theme-Docco** provides multiple shortcodes on top of existing ones.
