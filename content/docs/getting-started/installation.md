The following steps are here to help you initialize your new website. If you don’t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you learn more about it by following this [great documentation for beginners](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Create your project

Hugo provides a `new` command to create a new website.

```
hugo new site <new_project>
```
## Install the theme

Install the **Docco** theme by following [this documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-3-add-a-theme)

This theme's repository is: https://github.com/fatahdigital/docco

Alternatively, you can [download the theme as .zip](https://github.com/fatahdigital/docco/archive/master.zip) file.

## Install Hugo

You need a [recent extended version](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) (we recommend version 0.75.0 or later) of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to do local builds and previews of sites (like this one) that use Docco. If you install from the release page, make sure to get the extended Hugo version, which supports [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax); you may need to scroll down the list of releases to see it.

For comprehensive Hugo documentation, see [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/).

### Linux

Be careful using sudo apt-get install hugo, as it [doesn’t get you the extended version for all Debian/Ubuntu versions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#debian-and-ubuntu), and may not be up-to-date with the most recent Hugo version.

```
hugo version
```

If the result is ```v0.75``` or earlier, or if you don’t see Extended, you’ll need to install the latest version. You can see a complete list of Linux installation options in [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#linux). The following shows you how to install Hugo from the release page:

1.  Go to the [Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) page.
2.  In the most recent release, scroll down until you find a list of
    **Extended** versions.
3.  Download the latest extended version (`hugo_extended_0.5X_Linux-64bit.tar.gz`).
4.  Create a new directory:

        mkdir hugo

5.  Extract the files you downloaded to `hugo`.

6.  Switch to your new directory:

        cd hugo

7.  Install Hugo:

        sudo install hugo /usr/bin   

### macOS

Install Hugo using [Brew](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#homebrew-macos).

### As an `npm` module

You can install Hugo as an `npm` module using [`hugo-bin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-bin). This adds `hugo-bin` to your `node_modules` folder and adds the dependency to your `package.json` file.  To install the extended version of Hugo:

```
npm install hugo-extended --save-dev
```

See the [`hugo-bin` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-bin) for usage details.

### Install PostCSS

To build or update your site's CSS resources, you also need [`PostCSS`](https://postcss.org/) to create the final assets. If you need to install it, you must have a recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine so you can use `npm`, the Node package manager. By default `npm` installs tools under the directory where you run [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install#description):

```
sudo npm install -D autoprefixer
sudo npm install -D postcss-cli
```

Starting in [version 8 of `postcss-cli`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), you must also separately install `postcss`:

```
sudo npm install -D postcss
```

Note that versions of `PostCSS` later than 5.0.1 will not load `autoprefixer` if installed [globally](https://flaviocopes.com/npm-packages-local-global/), you must use a local install.

## Create your first content pages

Create content pages. Here are two ways to create content in the docs Folder:

```
hugo new docs/getting-started/first-content.md
hugo new docs/shortcodes/children/_index.md
```
Feel free to edit thoses files by adding some sample content and replacing the `title` value in the beginning of the files. 

## Launching the website locally

Launch by using the following command:

```
hugo serve
```

Go to `http://localhost:1313`

You should notice three things:

1. You have a left-side **Getting Started** menu, containing two submenus with names equal to the `title` properties in the previously created files.
2. The home page explains how to customize it by following the instructions.
3. When you run `hugo serve`, when the contents of the files change, the page automatically refreshes with the changes. Neat!

## Build the website

When your site is ready to deploy, run the following command:

```
hugo
```
A `public` folder will be generated, containing all static content and assets for your website. It can now be deployed on any web server.
