Archetypes are templates used when creating new content.

## What are Archetypes?

**Archetypes** are content template files in the archetypes directory of your project that contain preconfigured front matter and possibly also a content disposition for your website's content types. These will be used when you run `hugo new`.

The `hugo new` uses the `content-section` to find the most suitable archetype template in your project. If your project does not contain any archetype files, it will also look in the theme.

```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

The above will create a new content file in `content/posts/my-first-post.md` using the first archetype file found of these:

1. `archetypes/posts.md`
2. `archetypes/default.md`
3. `themes/my-theme/archetypes/posts.md`
4. `themes/my-theme/archetypes/default.md`

The last two list items are only applicable if you use a theme and it uses the `my-theme` theme name as an example.

## Create a New Archetype Template

A fictional example for the section `newsletter` and the archetype file `archetypes/newsletter.md`. Create a new file in `archetypes/newsletter.md` and open it in a text editor.
```
---
title: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
---

**Insert Lead paragraph here.**

## New Cool Posts

{{ range first 10 ( where .Site.RegularPages "Type" "cool" ) }}
* {{ .Title }}
{{ end }}
```

When you create a new newsletter with:

```bash
hugo new newsletter/the-latest-cool.stuff.md
```

It will create a new newsletter type of content file based on the archetype template.

**Note:** the site will only be built if the `.Site` is in use in the archetype file, and this can be time consuming for big sites.

The above _newsletter type archetype_ illustrates the possibilities: The full Hugo `.Site` and all of Hugo&#39;s template funcs can be used in the archetype file.

## Directory based archetypes

Since Hugo `0.49` you can use complete directories as archetype templates. Given this archetype directory:

```bash
archetypes
├── default.md
└── post-bundle
    ├── bio.md
    ├── images
    │   └── featured.jpg
    └── index.md
```

```bash
hugo new --kind post-bundle posts/my-post
```

Will create a new folder in `/content/posts/my-post` with the same set of files as in the `post-bundle` archetypes folder. All content files (`index.md` etc.) can contain template logic, and will receive the correct `.Site` for the content's language.

<!-- Using the command: `hugo new [relative new content path]`, you can start a content file with the date and title automatically set. While this is a welcome feature, active writers need more: [archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content/archetypes/).

It is pre-configured skeleton pages with default front matter. Please refer to the documentation for types of page to understand the differences.

## Chapter {#archetypes-chapter}

To create a Chapter page, run the following commands

```
hugo new --kind chapter <name>/_index.md
```

It will create a page with predefined Front-Matter:

```markdown
+++
title = "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"
date = {{ .Date }}
weight = 5
chapter = true
pre = "<b>X. </b>"
+++

### Chapter X

# Some Chapter title

Lorem Ipsum.
```

## Default

To create a default page, run either one of the following commands

```
# Either
hugo new <chapter>/<name>/_index.md
# Or
hugo new <chapter>/<name>.md
```

It will create a page with predefined Front-Matter:

```markdown
+++
title = "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"
date =  {{ .Date }}

``` -->
